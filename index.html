    <p>I'm gonna tell you a story
    I'm gonna tell you about my town
    I'm gonna tell you a big fat story, baby
    Aw, it's all about my town
    </p>
    <p>
    Yeah, down by the river
    Down by the banks of the river Charles
    (Aw, that's what's happenin' baby)
    That's where you'll find me
    Along with lovers, muggers, and thieves
    (Aw, but they're cool people)
    Well I love that dirty water
    Oh, Boston, you're my home
    </p>
    <p>
    (Oh, you're the number one place)
    Frustrated women (I mean they're frustrated)
    Have to be in by twelve o'clock (Oh, that's a shame)
    But I'm wishin' and a-hopin', oh
    That just once those doors weren't locked
    (I like to save time for my baby to walk around)
    Well I love that dirty water
    Oh, Boston, you're my home (Oh, yeah)
    </p>
    <p>
    Where it began, I can't begin to knowing
    But then I know it's growing strong
    Was in the spring
    And spring became the summer
    Who'd have believed you'd come along
    Hands, touching hands
    Reaching out, touching me, touching you
    Sweet Caroline
    Good times never seemed so good  
    </p>
    <p>
    I'd be inclined
    To believe they never would
    But now I
    Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely
    We filled it up with only two
    And when I hurt
    Hurting runs off my shoulders
    How can I hurt when I'm holding you
    One, touching one
    Reaching out, touching me, touching you
    Sweet Caroline
    Good times never seemed so good
    I'd be inclined
    To believe they never would
    Oh no, no
    Sweet Caroline
    Good times never seemed so good
    </p>
